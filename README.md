This is some python code that runs an auto-clicker program, the delay is how long before it clicks again, this one in particular hit 516 CPS on a personal localized CPS tester (online testers couldn't accurattly calculate it due to there being a delay with the internet, it simply clicks to fast).One thing to note is you need pnput in order to run it, and any footnotes that let you know not to do something is purely there for my own orginization, it is not a reqirement, but a suggestion.
Another thing to note is it does display the CPS, im not sure if this is 100% accutate, or if it is basing it off the delay, either way there really is no limit (other than your pc) to what the CPS could be, but be warned it may break, as I have not tested it at a higer CPS count, it may end up getting stuck on
